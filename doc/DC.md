# DC macro

This macro replaces the assembler's DC statement.
It implements the overrides, as specified by preceding invocations
of the [DCOVR macro](DCOVR.md).

## Syntax

``` hlasm
&LABEL   DC    ,                       * Arguments in &SYSLIST
```

The syntax for the DC macro is identical to that of the DC instruction.

## Macro code

The [DC macro](../bxamac/DC.mac) is in the BXAmac folder.
