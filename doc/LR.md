# LR macro

This macro replaces the LR instruction

Copying from a register to itself is suppressed.

## syntax

``` hlasm
&LABEL   LR    ,                       * Arguments are in SYSLIST
```

The syntax for the LR macro is identical to that of the LR instruction.

## Macro code

The [LR macro](../bxamac/LR.mac) is in the BXAmac folder.
